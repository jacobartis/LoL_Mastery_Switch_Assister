# League of Legends Mastery Switch Assister

A program to help with my friends League of Legends game mode where you pick champs another member of your party plays.

## Rules for the mode:
- Create a pool of your teams most played champs.
- Each player drafts a champ from each pool (that isn't shared with their own pool).
- Each pool is only used once

## This program:
This program includes a python file with classes for Summoners and Champ Pool and another with a discord bot to manage champ pools.
To make it work you need a riot api key (RiotApiKey) and a discord key (DiscordApiKey) and place them in the files of the name in brakets.
